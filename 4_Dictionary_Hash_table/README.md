Dictionary in python is based on Hash table format

Here I created a class to that behave like dictionaries but without directly exposing dictionary-like functionality.



 A dictionary data structure, also known as a hash table, is a fundamental concept in computer science. It's designed to store and manage data in a key-value format, where each key uniquely identifies a value. The central idea behind a hash table is the use of a hash function, which transforms the key into a hash value or index. This index is then used to determine the location where the associated value should be stored or retrieved.

In Python programming, hash tables are implemented using the built-in data structure called a "dictionary." Python dictionaries allow efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data based on keys. The keys can be of various types, including strings, numbers, and more. Python dictionaries leverage hash functions to quickly find the storage location for a given key and retrieve its associated value, making them a cornerstone of Python's data manipulation capabilities.
